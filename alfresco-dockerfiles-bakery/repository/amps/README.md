# Alfresco repository AMPs

Place here your Alfresco module Packages (AMPs) to be installed in the Alfresco
repository.

AMP packages should have the `.amp` extension and stick to the Alfresco module
packaging format as described in the [Alfresco documentation][amp].

The [in-process Alfresco SDK][sdk] provides a way to build well structured AMPs.

> Note that AMPs are not the recommanded way to extend Alfresco. You should
> prefer using the Alfresco SDK to build your extensions as JARs even better,
> use the [out-of-process AlfrescoSDK][oop] to
> build Docker images with your extensions.

By default the `scripts/fetch-artifacts.sh` script will fetch only the default
AMPs, see [artifacts.json](../artifacts.json) for additional information.

You can replace those, remove them to keep only the ones you need or add more.
Be careful though as some AMPs may depend on one another (e.g.
`googldrive-repo` depends on `alfresco-share-services`).
