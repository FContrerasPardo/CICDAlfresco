As outlined in the [Hyland Alfresco support
policy](https://docs.alfresco.com/support/latest/policies/deployment/),
pre-built container images are intended as reference for creating your own
customized images, incorporating deployment guidelines, security best practices,
and any necessary custom extensions. While this policy remains unchanged, we are
supporting the community further by open-sourcing the Alfresco Dockerfiles
Bakery, a tool designed to simplify the deployment of the Alfresco platform and
assist you in building tailored container images, with the help of [Docker
Bake](https://docs.docker.com/build/bake/).

## Recent changes

- We are migrating the `fetch-artifacts.sh` script to Python, which will be
  available as `fetch-artifacts.py`. The new script is more robust and easier to
  maintain, and it will be the default script for fetching artifacts in the
  future. We are also switching the previous `artifacts.json` format to a more
  human-readable and more easy to automate `artifacts-$ACS_VERSION.yaml` format.

## Prerequisites

Building images requires the following tools:

- A recent enough Docker installation (with `buildx` support)
- Credentials to access the Alfresco artifacts (Nexus server), if building
  Enterprise images
- Some common unix tools: `jq`, `yq`, `wget`, `make`
- Python 3 with pyyaml (`pip install pyyaml`) for fetching artifacts via the
  `fetch-artifacts.py` script

### Nexus authentication

Configuring the authentication to Alfresco Nexus server must be done using one
of the standard `wget` configuration files, like `~/.netrc`.

Using your preferred editor, create `~/.netrc` with the following contents:

```sh
machine nexus.alfresco.com
login myuser
password mypassword
```

Make sure to make the file non-world readable:

```sh
chmod 600 ~/.netrc
```

## Getting started quickly

If you do not plan on applying specific customizations but just want to get
Alfresco images updated (e.g. with the latest OS security patches), you can
simply run the command below from the root of this project:

```sh
make enterprise
```

or for Community edition:

```sh
make community
```

This command will build locally all the docker images this project offers.

For more information on the available images, browse the top level folders,
excluding `artifacts_cache`, `scripts` and `test`.

For more information on the available targets, run:

```sh
make help
```

Below are some environment variables which can be used to customize the build
process:

- `REGISTRY`: The registry where the images will be pushed (authentication is
  ensured by the `make` wrapper)
- `REGISTRY_NAMESPACE`: The namespace where the images will be pushed (e.g.
  REGISTRY/REGISTRY_NAMESPACE/IMAGE_NAME:TAG)
- `TAG`: The tag to use for the images (default is `latest`)
- `TARGETARCH`: The architecture to build the images for (default is the
  architecture of the system where the build is run). See [Supported
  Architectures](#supported-architectures) for more information.
- `BAKE_NO_CACHE`: Set to `1` to disable the cache during the build process
- `BAKE_NO_PROVENANCE`: Set to `1` to not add provenance metadata during the build
  process. This is mostly useful if your registry do not support it.

For example, to build multi-arch images for ARM64 and X86_64 and push them to a
custom registry, you can run the following command:

```sh
export REGISTRY=myecr.domain.tld REGISTRY_NAMESPACE=myalfrescobuilds TARGETARCH=linux/amd64,linux/arm64
make all
```

## Customizing the images

### Customizing the Alfresco Content Repository image

The Alfresco Content Repository image can be customized by adding different
types of files in the right locations:

- Alfresco Module Packages (AMPs) files in the [amps](repository/amps/README.md)
  folder
  - Enterprise-only AMPs files in the [amps-enterprise](repository/amps_enterprise/README.md)
    folder
  - Community-only AMPs files in the [amps-community](repository/amps_community/README.md)
    folder
- Additional JAR files for the JRE in the [libs](repository/libs/README.md) folder

## Supported Architectures

Depending on the environment where you plan to run the docker images you build,
it is possible to build Alfresco images the following architectures:

- X86_64 (linux/amd64): Regular intel processor based systems
- ARM64 (linux/arm64): ARM processor based systems (e.g. Apple Silicon or AWS
  Graviton)

By default, the images are built for the architecture of the system where the
build is run.

### Targeting a specific architecture

To build images for a specific architecture, you can set the `TARGETARCH`
environment variable to the desired architecture.
For example, to build all Alfresco images for ARM64, you can run the following
command:

```sh
export TARGETARCH=linux/arm64
make all
```

To build just a specific image use you'll need to use `docker buildx bake`
directly, but the `TARGETARCH` environment variable also works:

```sh
export TARGETARCH=linux/arm64
docker buildx bake tengine_imagemagick
```

### Multi-arch images

Images can be built with multi-arch support. This is done by using the
same environment variable as above, and passing target architectures as a
comma-separated list.
By doing so, you're not solely build an image and its manifest, but a list of
manifests for each target architecture. That makes it possible to reference the
same image name and tag, and have the right image pulled for the right
architecture.

```sh
export TARGETARCH=linux/amd64,linux/arm64
make all
```

It's important to note that building multi-arch images requires the use of
Docker BuildKit, which is enabled by default in Docker 20.10 and later and
also requires images to be pushed to a registry that supports multi-arch.

:warning: Multi-arch build cannot be loaded into the local docker image cache.
This is due to a limitation of the `docker` exporter in BuildKit.
In order to produce multi-arch images one needs to:

- Set the REGISTRY environment variable to the target registry
- Set the REGISTRY_NAMESPACE environment variable to the target namespace

The `make` wrapper would handle the authentication part for you:

```sh
export REGISTRY=myecr.domain.tld REGISTRY_NAMESPACE=myalfrescobuilds TARGETARCH=linux/amd64,linux/arm64
make repo
```

You can also run bake directly but you need to be sure to have done the
authentication before running the `docker buildx bake` command with an
additional argument to tell the tool to push the images to the registry:

```sh
export REGISTRY=myecr.domain.tld REGISTRY_NAMESPACE=myalfrescobuilds TARGETARCH=linux/amd64,linux/arm64
docker buildx bake repo --set *.output=type=registry,push=true
```

## Building older versions

Versions of artifacts being downloaded specific to the ACS version are defined in `artifacts.json` files for each component.

To build older version pass `ACS_VERSION` env to make command.
- ACS 23 (current) - `ACS_VERSION=23` - `"acs23"` section in `artifacts.json` files - set by default
- ACS 7.4 - `ACS_VERSION=74` - `"acs74"` section in `artifacts.json` files
- ACS 7.3 - `ACS_VERSION=73` - `"acs73"` section in `artifacts.json` files

```sh
make enterprise ACS_VERSION=74
```

Make sets the correct version of Tomcat based on the ACS version. If you want to
build older version of images using `docker buildx bake` it is required to set
the Tomcat versions manually in bake file or using env variables.

```sh
export TOMCAT_VERSIONS_FILE=tomcat/tomcat_versions.yaml
export TOMCAT_MAJOR=$(yq e '.tomcat9.major' $TOMCAT_VERSIONS_FILE)
export TOMCAT_VERSION=$(yq e '.tomcat9.version' $TOMCAT_VERSIONS_FILE)
export TOMCAT_SHA512=$(yq e '.tomcat9.sha512' $TOMCAT_VERSIONS_FILE)
docker buildx bake tomcat_base
```

Before switching build to other version clean the artifacts using `make clean`
then fetch correct version with e.g.:

```sh
make clean prepare ACS_VERSION=74
```

## Testing locally

Once the images are built, you can test them locally using either Helm or Docker Compose.

### Testing with helm

Follow the general instructions for [installing Alfresco on
KinD](https://alfresco.github.io/acs-deployment/docs/helm/kind-deployment.html)
until the point where you have to run `helm install`.

If the images has not been pushed to a remote repository, you can easily load
all the locally built images in the local KinD cluster with:

```sh
kind load docker-image $(docker images --format "{{.Repository}}" | grep "^localhost/alfresco" | xargs)
```

Before running the `helm install` command, you need adjust the registry and
image namespace references in the provided
[test-overrides.yaml](test/helm/test-overrides.yaml) file:

```sh
REGISTRY=localhost REGISTRY_NAMESPACE=alfresco TAG=latest
sed -i "s|localhost/alfresco/|${REGISTRY}/${REGISTRY_NAMESPACE}/|g" test/helm/test-overrides.yaml
sed -i "s|tag: latest|tag: ${TAG}|g" test/helm/test-overrides.yaml
```

If you are testing the community edition, you also need to adjust the image
references for the Share and Repository images:

```sh
sed -i "s|/alfresco-content-repository|/alfresco-content-repository-community|g" test/helm/test-overrides.yaml
sed -i "s|/alfresco-share|/alfresco-share-community|g" test/helm/test-overrides.yaml
```

Then you can finally run `helm install` passing as values the provided files.

For enterprise edition:

```sh
helm install acs alfresco/alfresco-content-services \
  --values=test/helm/enterprise-integration-test-values.yaml \
  --values=test/helm/test-overrides.yaml \
  --values=test/helm/test-overrides-enterprise.yaml \
  --atomic \
  --timeout 10m0s \
  --namespace alfresco
```

For community edition:

```sh
helm install acs alfresco/alfresco-content-services \
  --values=test/helm/community_values.yaml \
  --values=test/helm/community-integration-test-values.yaml \
  --values=test/helm/test-overrides.yaml \
  --values=test/helm/test-overrides-community.yaml \
  --set global.search.sharedSecret=$(openssl rand -hex 24) \
  --atomic \
  --timeout 10m0s \
  --namespace=alfresco
```

### Testing with docker compose

You can use Docker Compose to test the built images locally as follows:

1. Fetch upstream compose from acs-deployment repository using the provided
   script (you can specify a git branch or tag):

   ```sh
   ./scripts/fetch-compose.sh master
   ```

2. Run compose together with one of the available override files, which allow
   you to easily reference built images using
   `$REGISTRY/$REGISTRY_NAMESPACE/component-name:$TAG` format:

   ```sh
   REGISTRY=localhost REGISTRY_NAMESPACE=alfresco TAG=latest
   docker compose -f test/compose.yaml -f test/enterprise-override.yaml up -d
   ```

   For community edition instead:

    ```sh
    REGISTRY=localhost REGISTRY_NAMESPACE=alfresco TAG=latest
    docker compose -f test/community-compose.yaml -f test/community-override.yaml up -d
    ```

## Security scanning

The images built by this project may be scanned for vulnerabilities using Grype,
if the `grype` binary is available in the PATH.

> Grype is an open-source scanner for container images, ideal for identifying
> recent vulnerabilities, especially within base OS images. While it supports
> application libraries, it lacks reachability analysis, meaning it cannot
> confirm whether vulnerabilities are actually exploitable in the context of the
> application. For accurate insights, refer to Alfresco Security bulletins and
> contact Hyland support, as these sources provide vetted information after
> manual triaging of scanner findings within the application code. Remember to
> always assess findings within the context of your specific deployment.

If you want to run the security scan manually, you can use the following command:

```sh
make grype GRYPE_TARGET=repo GRYPE_OPTS="-f high --only-fixed --ignore-states wont-fix"
```

You can pass `GRYPE_OPTS` to override the default options passed to Grype, which
by default exit with a non-zero status if any vulnerability greater than high is
found and is filtering out known issues for which a fix is not available (yet or
ever).

You can also run grype automatically at the end of the build process by setting
`GRYPE_ONBUILD`:

```sh
make all GRYPE_ONBUILD=1
```
